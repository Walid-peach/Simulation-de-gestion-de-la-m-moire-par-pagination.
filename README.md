# Simulation-de-gestion-de-la-m-moire-par-pagination.
This project generally consists of managing programs and memory space. Based on two different data structures the linked lists and the linked doubled lists. After having reserved the space of the empty pages in memory, we load the program, add it to the list of programs and then delete the occupied pages from the list of empty pages. You can also display the list of loaded programs, the pages of a given program or even the list of free pages in memory, without forgetting the deletion of the program or terminating its execution while keeping the state of the memory that the You can always display before exiting the program.
